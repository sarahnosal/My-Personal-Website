        <p1>I am a 29 year old Software Engineer in-training, currently living out of San Antonio, TX. 
            Thank you for visiting my website! You will see it develop as I learn more about coding.
            My background is not in tech at all- my entire professional career (as you will see outlined below) has been in sales and finance. 
            When I'm not coding, I spend my time with my boyfriend Eric, and training my 2 year old dog, Duchess. 
            Hobbies include playing piano, working out, crafting, and reading. 
            I'm hoping that this website will provide a tribute to my love for the Lord as well show my progress in software engineering. </p1>
